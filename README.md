# IROS 2022 Workshop: Probabilistic Robotics In the age of Deep Learning

### 1. Adding content to a section

Each section has its own file in the `_posts` directory. Simply add Markdown compatible content below the the header (the header is defined within `---`).
This can be done in a local clone as well as directly in the GitHub file editor.

### 2. Adding sections

To add a new section, copy an existing one and:
1. Change the filename to `2022-01-xx-section-name.md` where `xx` is the section ID used for sorting the sections.
2. Change the title in the section header.
3. Change the section content below the header (see above).

### 3. Changing the style (advanced)

* The layout of the website is defined in `_layouts/default.html`. Different elements of the website are defined in the `_includes` directory and imported into `default.html`.
* The style (`css`) of the website elements is defined in `_includes/css/main.css`.
* The banner (hero image) is located in `img/banner.jpg`.
* Site metadata (title, author, url, etc.) is defined in `_config.yaml`.
